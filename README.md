Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! I tried to spice this repo up with a bunch of nice-to-haves. Since I started with AOC in 2020, I have haphazardly collected the daily Python files and manually collected the inputs. This had to change! So I incorporated the following features into my workflow:

* CLI utility to setup a new year, with all the daily files ready to go.
* Automatic data collection through [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data)
* Time profiling using a decorator function
* Yearly star tracker in the README using Github Actions and [AoC Badges](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aoc-badges)
* Virtual environment and dependency management with Pyenv and Poetry
* Automated re-commit checks like Mypy and Black formatting through [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
