<p>
Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! I tried to spice this repo up with a bunch of nice-to-haves. Since I started with AOC in 2020, I have haphazardly collected the daily Python files and manually collected the inputs. This had to change! So I incorporated the following features into my workflow:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> CLI utility to setup a new year, with all the daily files ready to go.</li>
  <li>Automatic data collection through <a href=""https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data>advent-of-code-data</a></li>
  <li>Yearly star tracker in the README using Github Actions and <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aoc-badges">AoC Badges</a></li>
  <li>Virtual environment and dependency management with Pyenv and Poetry</li>
<li>Automated pre-commit checks like Mypy and Black formatting through <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit</a></li>
